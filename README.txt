JavaScript Game README:


1. Our game is very dynamic. There are lots of moving parts to process, especially between collisions. We have to track all of our moving images and ensure its moving appropriately. There is a lot of feedback and timing going on in our game.
The components all together make this game complex, even for a basic game. Our tracking system is fairly accurate to a degree. It took lots of time, testing, and debugging to get our project to work. Also merging and script sharing was very tedious.
2. We used text decorations like text shadows. We used rounded borders, and we used a box shadow for our canvas and title.
3. We did not use any cool Javascript libraries ( :( ). We used ordinary javascript and jQuery.
4. The collision detection, timing was difficult, and the HighScore API. We couldn't figure out how to call a function from another file.
